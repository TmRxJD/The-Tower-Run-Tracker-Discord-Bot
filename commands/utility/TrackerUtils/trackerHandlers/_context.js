/**
 * CONTEXT FILE FOR COPILOT
 * 
 * This file keeps track of our work together to ensure consistency
 * even in the event of disconnections or context loss.
 * 
 * CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. NEVER make assumptions about implementation details.
 * 2. ALWAYS use existing code before writing new code.
 * 3. NEVER make fundamental changes to functionality or display.
 * 4. ASK QUESTIONS before proceeding if anything is unclear.
 * 5. DISCUSS implementation approaches BEFORE implementing them.
 * 6. COPY exactly when extracting code from existing files.
 * 7. MAINTAIN original functionality, variable names, and patterns.
 * 8. DO NOT introduce new ways of doing things when refactoring.
 * 
 * PROJECT CONTEXT:
 * 
 * - We are refactoring trackerHandlers.js into smaller modular files
 * - Each module should keep the same logic and structure as the original
 * - Code should be moved, not rewritten or "improved"
 * 
 * WORK HISTORY:
 * 
 * [2025-05-04] Created dataReviewHandlers.js
 * - Copied code from trackerHandlers.js to dataReviewHandlers.js
 * - Renamed showDataReview to handleDataReview 
 * - Renamed handleDataAccept to handleDataSubmission
 * - Added module export for handleDataReview and handleDataSubmission
 * - Added required imports
 * 
 * [2025-05-04] Created settingsHandlers.js
 * - Extracted settings flow from trackerHandlers.js
 * - Replaced the decimal preference dropdown with a toggle button
 * - Kept a dedicated dropdown just for language selection
 * - Used emoji indicators for decimal preference (üîµ for period, üî¥ for comma)
 * - Added more language options (Japanese, Korean)
 * 
 * [2025-05-04] Updated settingsHandlers.js
 * - Replaced multiple run type buttons with a dropdown menu
 * - Added emojis for each run type (üåæ farming, üåô overnight, üèÜ tournament, üèÅ milestone)
 * - Reorganized components layout for better user experience
 * - Updated the event handler to process the new run type dropdown selection
 * 
 * USER FEEDBACK:
 * 
 * [2025-05-04] User noted not to change the way things are displayed
 * - Must preserve existing code patterns exactly
 * - Do not make assumptions or improvements
 * - Always discuss before proceeding
 * 
 * ACTION ITEMS:
 * 
 * 1. Continue refactoring other handler files
 * 2. Ensure exact copying of code without changes
 * 3. Ask questions about proper module organization
 * 4. Discuss all approaches before implementation
